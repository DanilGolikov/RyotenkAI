"""Phase 9.C — observability constants for the cancellation chain.

A single source of truth for the event kinds the cancellation flow
emits. Spread across three processes:

* In-pod runner (Supervisor): ``cancellation_started`` /
  ``cancellation_completed`` from the FSM transitions.
* Trainer subprocess (CancellationCallback): ``cancellation_finalized``
  after the on_train_end MLflow flush.
* Mac control plane (TrainingMonitor): ``mlflow_reconciled_post_sigkill``
  /  ``cleanup_pod_failed`` from reconciliation + cleanup.

Defining the kind strings here keeps them grep-able across the
codebase. Operator dashboards / SLO alerts key off these strings —
renaming requires bumping every consumer at once, which makes the
visibility intentional.

Latency contract
----------------

Every event in the chain carries ``latency_ms`` measured against a
common anchor: the ``cancellation_started`` event's
``requested_at_ms`` field. Specifically:

* ``cancellation_started.requested_at_ms`` — anchor (epoch ms).
* ``cancellation_finalized.latency_ms`` — flush completion to
  anchor.
* ``cancellation_completed.total_latency_ms`` — FSM-terminal to
  anchor.

The clock is :func:`time.time` (epoch ms) rather than
:func:`time.monotonic` because we want timestamps to round-trip
through JSON / Mac log scrapes / MLflow run metadata. Monotonic
clocks aren't comparable across process boundaries; epoch is.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Event kind constants
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: Operator pressed Stop (CLI / Web UI). Optional — Phase 9.C reserves
#: the kind for a future Mac-side event published the moment the
#: control plane receives the request, before the runner round-trip.
#: Not emitted in 9.C (placeholder so consumers know the schema).
CANCELLATION_REQUESTED = "cancellation_requested"

#: Supervisor caught the stop request and transitioned FSM to
#: ``stopping``. Carries:
#:   * ``requested_at_ms`` — anchor for downstream latency.
#:   * ``grace_seconds`` — supervisor's SIGKILL escalation budget.
#:   * ``reason`` — short identifier (``"sigterm"``, ``"idle_timeout"``,
#:     ``"max_lifetime"`` ...).
CANCELLATION_STARTED = "cancellation_started"

#: Trainer's :class:`CancellationCallback.on_train_end` finished its
#: MLflow flush (success OR timed out — distinguished by
#: ``flush_timed_out`` in payload). Carries:
#:   * ``latency_ms`` — wall time from cancellation_started.
#:   * ``flushed_count`` — records drained from the resilient buffer.
#:   * ``flush_timed_out`` — bool; True triggers Mac reconciliation.
#:   * ``marker_written`` — bool; True if cancelled.marker was
#:     written for Mac-side reconciliation pickup.
CANCELLATION_FINALIZED = "cancellation_finalized"

#: Supervisor reaped the trainer subprocess; FSM landed in terminal
#: state. Carries:
#:   * ``total_latency_ms`` — wall time from cancellation_started to
#:     reap.
#:   * ``terminal_state`` — ``"cancelled"`` / ``"failed"`` / ``"completed"``.
#:   * ``exit_code``, ``signal`` — for forensics.
CANCELLATION_COMPLETED = "cancellation_completed"

#: Trainer's :class:`CompletionCallback.on_train_end` finished its
#: MLflow flush on the **natural-completion** path (Phase 11.A) —
#: training reached ``max_steps`` / ``num_train_epochs`` without
#: anyone pressing Stop. Counterpart to
#: :data:`CANCELLATION_FINALIZED`. Carries:
#:   * ``flushed_count`` — records drained from the resilient buffer.
#:   * ``flush_timed_out`` — bool; True ⇒ partial flush, marker
#:     payload's ``reason`` is ``"flush_budget_exceeded"``.
#:   * ``marker_written`` — bool; ``completion.marker`` is written
#:     **always** on natural end (per Phase 11 design), so this
#:     should be True except on disk-write failure.
#:   * ``flush_budget_seconds`` — the deadline used (debug aid).
COMPLETION_FINALIZED = "completion_finalized"

#: Mac-side reconciliation forced an MLflow run from ``RUNNING`` →
#: ``KILLED`` because the trainer SIGKILLed before ``end_run`` ran.
#: Carries:
#:   * ``run_id`` — MLflow run that was reconciled.
#:   * ``marker_path`` — where the cancelled.marker lived.
MLFLOW_RECONCILED_POST_SIGKILL = "mlflow_reconciled_post_sigkill"

#: Mac-side ``provider.cleanup_pod`` failed (RunPod GraphQL down,
#: SSH unreachable for single_node, etc.). Operator-visible signal
#: that pod billing may continue accruing — manual cleanup needed.
#: Carries:
#:   * ``provider`` — ``"runpod"`` / ``"single_node"``.
#:   * ``pod_id`` — when known.
#:   * ``error_code`` / ``message`` — structured for filtering.
CLEANUP_POD_FAILED = "cleanup_pod_failed"


#: Phase 12.C — :class:`EventBus` failed to write a record to its
#: :class:`EventJournal`. Rate-limited 1/min per bus instance to
#: avoid feedback loops where the disk-pressure event itself
#: floods the journal. Carries:
#:   * ``error_code`` — usually ``"OSError"`` or ``"IOError"``.
#:   * ``total_bytes`` — current journal footprint at signalling time.
#:   * ``file_count`` — how many JSONL files exist.
EVENTS_DISK_PRESSURE = "events_disk_pressure"

#: Phase 12.C — :class:`EventJournal` advanced from
#: ``events.NNN.jsonl`` → ``events.NNN+1.jsonl`` because the cap was
#: hit. Carries:
#:   * ``from_seq`` — file just closed.
#:   * ``to_seq`` — new active file.
#:   * ``file_size_bytes`` — bytes written to the just-closed file.
#:   * ``oldest_remaining_seq`` — smallest seq still on disk after
#:     drop-oldest enforcement.
EVENTS_ROTATED = "events_rotated"

#: Phase 12.C — :class:`EventJournal` deleted at least one file
#: during init-time crash recovery (interrupted ``.tmp`` file or
#: stale rotation residue). Distinct from the per-rotate drop-oldest
#: which is implicit in :data:`EVENTS_ROTATED`. Carries:
#:   * ``deleted_seqs`` — list of seq numbers deleted.
#:   * ``deleted_bytes`` — cumulative size of removed files.
EVENTS_GC_RAN = "events_gc_ran"

#: Phase 12.C — :class:`ModelRetriever` finished its
#: ``metrics_buffer.jsonl`` retrieval + replay attempt (Phase 12.A.1).
#: Mirrors :class:`ModelRetrieverEventCallbacks.on_metrics_buffer_retrieved`
#: as a structured bus event so dashboards can track replay outcomes
#: per attempt. Carries:
#:   * ``replayed`` — int, count of metrics shipped to MLflow.
#:   * ``line_count`` — int, lines in the retrieved buffer file.
#:   * ``size_bytes`` — int, remote file size.
#:   * ``missing`` — bool, True ⇒ trainer drain succeeded; healthy.
#:   * ``oversized`` — bool, True ⇒ buffer over the 100 MiB safety cap.
