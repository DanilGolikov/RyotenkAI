# Report plugins

**What they do.** Build one block (section) of the experiment report written at the end of every run. The composer [`src/reports/plugins/composer.py`](../../src/reports/plugins/composer.py) calls `render()` on each plugin in `order`, collects the returned IR nodes (headings, paragraphs, tables), and [`src/reports/plugins/markdown_block_renderer.py`](../../src/reports/plugins/markdown_block_renderer.py) turns them into Markdown.

Fail-open: if a plugin raises during `render()`, the composer substitutes an error block — the rest of the report is unaffected.

## Where the engine lives

- Interfaces: [`src/reports/plugins/interfaces.py`](../../src/reports/plugins/interfaces.py) → `IReportBlockPlugin` (Protocol), `ReportBlock`, `ReportPluginContext`, `PluginExecutionRecord`
- Registry: [`src/reports/plugins/registry.py`](../../src/reports/plugins/registry.py) → attribute mapping happens at load time (see note below)
- Composer: [`src/reports/plugins/composer.py`](../../src/reports/plugins/composer.py)
- IR document nodes: [`src/reports/document/nodes.py`](../../src/reports/document/nodes.py)
- Inline helpers: `txt`, `strong`, `emph`, `code`, `inlines`

## Minimal layout

```
community/reports/<plugin_id>/
├── manifest.toml
└── plugin.py             # or plugin/ package
```

## `manifest.toml` format

```toml
[plugin]
id = "my_block"                # → becomes plugin_id on the class
kind = "reports"               # required literal
name = "My Block"              # human-readable (defaults to id)
version = "1.0.0"
priority = 75                  # → becomes `order` on the class; must be unique across reports
category = "report"
stability = "stable"
description = "Renders the … block of the experiment report."

[plugin.entry_point]
module = "plugin"
class  = "MyBlockPlugin"
```

Report plugins do not use `params_schema` / `thresholds_schema` / `secrets` — they read everything from the `ReportPluginContext` they receive.

## Loader ↔ class mapping

Report plugins predate the community contract and keep their legacy attribute names. The loader maps manifest fields onto the class automatically:

| Manifest field | Class attribute |
|---|---|
| `plugin.id` | `plugin_id` |
| `plugin.priority` | `order` |
| `plugin.name` | `title` (not auto-attached — set it yourself, see below) |

You write `plugin_id` / `order` in `manifest.toml`, not on the class.

## Class contract

```python
# community/reports/my_block/plugin.py
from __future__ import annotations

from src.reports.document.nodes import DocBlock, Heading, Paragraph, Table, inlines, txt
from src.reports.plugins.interfaces import ReportBlock, ReportPluginContext


class MyBlockPlugin:
    # These are overwritten by the loader from manifest.toml — leaving them
    # here is harmless and keeps the class self-documenting.
    plugin_id = "my_block"
    order = 75

    title = "My Custom Block"

    def render(self, ctx: ReportPluginContext) -> ReportBlock:
        nodes: list[DocBlock] = [
            Heading(2, inlines(txt(self.title))),
            Paragraph(inlines(txt(f"Run: {ctx.run_id}"))),
            Table(
                headers=["metric", "value"],
                rows=[["duration_s", str(ctx.data.summary.duration_s)]],
            ),
        ]
        return ReportBlock(
            block_id=self.plugin_id,
            title=self.title,
            order=self.order,
            nodes=nodes,
        )
```

### Rules

- `block_id` in the returned `ReportBlock` **must** equal `self.plugin_id`.
- `order` **must** be unique across all report plugins — duplicates raise at registry build time.
- `plugin_id` **must** be unique across all report plugins.
- Do **not** call `mlflow` / `open()` / network inside `render()` — the composer catches exceptions, but your block turns into an error placeholder. Query via `ctx.data_provider` and `ctx.data` instead.

## The `ReportPluginContext`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class ReportPluginContext:
    run_id: str
    data_provider: IExperimentDataProvider   # query helpers (metrics, artifacts, …)
    data: ExperimentData                      # pre-fetched run data
    report: ExperimentReport                  # assembled report so far (read-only-ish)
    logger: Logger
    clock: Clock = datetime.now               # inject for tests
```

Most plugins only need `ctx.data` (typed entity with config, metrics, stages, phases) and `ctx.report` (lets a late-order plugin read what earlier plugins produced).

## Document IR

Available node types from [`src/reports/document/nodes.py`](../../src/reports/document/nodes.py):

- `Heading(level, inlines)` — 1–6
- `Paragraph(inlines)`
- `Table(headers, rows)`
- `BulletList(items)`
- `CodeBlock(language, code)`
- `BlockQuote(inlines)`
- `HorizontalRule()`

Inline helpers: `txt("…")`, `strong("…")`, `emph("…")`, `code("…")`, `inlines(*parts)`.

Build the IR tree; don't format Markdown by hand. The renderer handles escaping and layout.

## Order guidelines

| Range | Block type |
|---|---|
| 10–20 | Header, summary |
| 30–50 | Issues, dataset validation, evaluation, model config |
| 60–80 | Memory, training config, phase details |
| 90–110 | Metrics, timelines, config dump |
| 120+ | Footer |

`order` collisions are a loader-time error, pick a free slot.

## Enabling the plugin

Report plugins run automatically for every completed run — there is no per-plugin toggle in pipeline config today. Drop a new one into `community/reports/<id>/`, restart the API, and it joins the next generated report.

## Sharing

Folder or zip, same as other kinds.

## Examples in this directory

| Folder | Block | Order |
|---|---|---|
| `header/` | Run title + status + duration | 10 |
| `summary/` | Phase overview table | 20 |
| `issues/` | Warnings and errors | 30 |
| `dataset_validation/` | Validation plugin results | 40 |
| `evaluation_block/` | Evaluation plugin results | 45 |
| `model_configuration/` | Model / adapter config | 50 |
| `memory_management/` | GPU memory analysis | 60 |
| `training_configuration/` | Training hyperparameters | 70 |
| `phase_details/` | Per-phase training details | 80 |
| `metrics_analysis/` | Loss trend analysis | 90 |
| `stage_timeline/` | Pipeline stage timeline | 100 |
| `config_dump/` | Full pipeline config snapshot | 110 |
| `footer/` | Footer with timestamps | 120 |
